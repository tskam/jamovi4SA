## Getting to Know jamovi User Interfaces

jamovi's user interface is structured with a spreadsheet-style data editor, an analyses area, and a ribbon at the top for accessing functions. The spreadsheet allows for data entry and editing, while the analyses section displays results and options. The ribbon provides access to various functions, including file operations, data manipulation, and statistical analyses.

This section aims to provide new users of jamovi a high level orientation of these interfaces.

-   launch jamovi.

When first starting jamovi, your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](images/img1-3.jpg)

On the left is the spreadsheet view where the data will appear. On the right is where the results of statistical analyses appear.

Let us take a closer look at the menu bar of jamovi. At the very top level, there are five tabs, namely: File tab, Variable ribbon, Data ribbon, Analyses ribbon, and Edit ribbon.

### File Tab

You can enter data directly into the jamovi spreadsheet, or if you already have the data in another data file format, you can open that file in jamovi. Jamovi supports a wide range of file types, including CSV, XLSX, SPSS, Stata, SAS, and more.

To open an existing dataset, click on the three lines in the upper left-hand corner ![](images/img1-5a.jpg){width="44"}

Three horizonal lines that indicate the menu button

Six options are available after clicking on the File tab. They are: New, Open, Special Import, Save, Save As, and Export.

-   New option helps you to start work on a new spreadsheet where you can enter your data, can define variables, etc.

-   Open option helps to open or to call different types of existing data files from where the files are stored on your working computer/laptop. These files were opened in jamovi, sometimes. These files may be jamovi (.omv) files, common separate values (.csv) files, EXCEL (.xls) files, SPSS (.sav) files and SAS (.sas) files. To open a file, first, click on the ‘Open’ option and then browse the file from the location where you stored that file. These files are classified into three categories.

    -   Native Data files are files that are created by jamovi itself with the extension .omv. These files are jamovi’s files. It is created after saving the file in jamovi.
    -   Unformatted Data files are the most commonly used format all over the World for data analysis on any data analysis software. It is commonly known as Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. It has .csv as file extension.
    -   Spreadsheet files are the files generated by the spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel with .xls file extension, SPSS with .sav file extension, SAS with .sas file extension, etc.

- Special Import Option is designed to update or append data to an existing jamovi data set. It is primarily used to import data into an existing data set, adding new data while preserving the existing structure and variable properties. It's different from the "Open" command, which creates a new data set. When using "Special Import" with a blank data set, the existing columns are retained. However, it's important to note that using "Special Import" on an existing .omv file might cause the loss of missing values and other variable properties, according to a Jamovi forum [post](https://forum.jamovi.org/viewtopic.php?t=3695).

### Variables Ribbon

In Variables tab, you will see a list of the variables in your data set, including the Name, Description, and a symbol that indicates the variable measure type (nominal, ordinal, continuous, or ID). This view is useful for reviewing all the variables in your dataset and locating a specific variable when you have many of them.

![](images/img1-6.jpg)

The top ribbon provides options for editing variable information, computing new variables, transforming existing variables, adding new column, deleting existing column and filtering records.

### Data Ribbon

With the Data Tab selected, you will see a spreadsheet view of your data as shown below. 

![](images/img1-8.jpg)

In Data view:

- Each line represents a records, and 
- Each column represents a variable (i.e., Gender )

The top ribbon provides similar options to Variables view: setup variable information, computing new variables, editing variable information, computing new variables, transforming existing variables, adding new column, deleting existing column and filtering records.

### Analyses Ribbon

In Analyses view you will also see the spreadsheet view of your data. However, now the top ribbon options include menus of different groups of statistical analyses.

![](images/img1-9.jpg)

The analysis ribbon or menu is at the top of the window. 

![](images/img1-10.jpg)

When you select an analysis, an options panel will appear, allowing you to configure the analysis and select variables.

![](images/img1-11.jpg)

Assign your data variables to the appropriate fields in the analysis options panel. jamovi will display the results in the results panel.

### Edit Ribbon

The Edit tab in jamovi primarily allows users to add and modify annotations within the analysis results, enhancing clarity and providing context for the output. It allows users to highlight specific results, add notes, and make other textual edits to the output panel. 

![](images/img1-13.jpg)

Specifically, the Edit tab provides data analysts the following features:

- Adding and editing annotations: Data analysts can add text-based notes and comments to results to explain findings, highlight important points, or provide context for specific analyses. 
- Formatting annotations: It allows data analysts to format their annotations with options like bolding, italics, colors, and different font styles. 
- Highlighting results: Data analysts can highlight specific results within the output panel to draw attention to key findings or areas of interest. 
- Changing the display of results:
While the Edit tab doesn't offer in-depth control over the underlying statistical calculations or the layout of tables and figures, it does allow data analysts to make minor adjustments to the display within the results panel. For example, data analysts can rename headings or add labels to tables.
